# Algorithms

I use this repo to practice and study algorithms and data-structures.
Here I have some programming challenges I solved while practicing and sometimes implementing basic data-structures that are already provided by Java (or any decent programming language). 
By no means, this is an intention to reinvent the wheel. I use and recommend using what is provided by Java API instead of creating your own data-structures and algorithms for common problems. 

Again, this is all for practicing purposes.

## Data Structures

For each data-structure presented below, there are algorithms solving common problems using these data-structures.
Whenever I find it convenient or important for myself, I document my understanding on how to solve the problem and 
my understanding about algorithms presented.

Some fundamental data-structures that may be either implemented or just used to solve some problems.
- [Arrays](src/main/java/com/adolfoeloy/arrays)
- [Stack](src/main/java/com/adolfoeloy/datastructure/stack)
- [Queue](src/main/java/com/adolfoeloy/datastructure/queue)
- [Binary heap](src/main/java/com/adolfoeloy/datastructure/heap)
- [Binary Search Trees](src/main/java/com/adolfoeloy/datastructure/bst) (includes RB BST)
- [Graphs](src/main/java/com/adolfoeloy/graph)
