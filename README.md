# Algorithms

I use this repo to practice and study algorithms and data-structures.
Here I have some programming challenges I solved while practicing and sometimes implementations of data-structures that are already provided by Java. By no means, this is an intention to reinvent the wheel. I use and recommend using what is provided by Java API instead of creating our own data-structures and algorithms for common problems. This is all for practicing purposes.
