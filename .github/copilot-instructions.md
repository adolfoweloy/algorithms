# Purpose

This repository was created to track my progress in practicing algorithms and data structures as well as solving problems from LeetCode.

# Basic Instructions

- Use clear and descriptive commit messages.
- Do not give me the solutions to the problems directly. Before sharing any code, ask me if I want to see any piece of solution.

# Stack
- Java 25
- Maven

# Testing

- Use idiomatic JUnit 5 when writing unit tests and assertj to write the assertions.
